## The usual Pinterest, but more practical and efficient!
### Download from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinterest-enhanced/egpachgbfnbpkceigfpcpicekmiehame)

With this Chrome Extension you will be able to focus on content and images, with an enhanced UI and without any distraction.

The key features are:

- All pins have the same height, so too large images will not draw all your attention.
- Pins information will appear only on mouse over, let you pay more attention to images
- Long pins will slide on mouse over, so it will be not always necessary to open it to examine it.
- Navigate through pins with left and right keys.
- Download pin images.
- Search images on google.

And, if you want to revert to normal Pinterest, you have simply to click the icon in the address bar!

Give it a try :)
